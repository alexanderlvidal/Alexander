								<h2>Objective</h2>
								<p>The objective of this project was to create a functional website using HTML5 and write in detail how the website was created. The website should also have my contact information as well as my resume.</p>

                                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                                <b>Step 1</b>
                                <p>I learned the basics of HTML from lectures on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfDa07tpTJo&list=PLGuNTpc293hpIpAVSJ3-SgNolCTa1BfJE&index=3">Canvas</a> and the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3 Schools</a>. Once I understood the basics i read the <a href="https://haskoliislands.instructure.com/courses/24153/assignments/88375">project description</a> and got started.
                                </p>
                                
                                
                                <b>Step 2</b>
                                <p>I made an account at <a href="https://github.com">github</a> and downloaded the program called Brackets via <a href="https://brackets.io">this link.</a> Brackets is a great and simple program to use to write HTML code and the Live Preview feature is very helpful.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/live_editor.png" alt="" width="500" height="260"/></p>
                                
                                <b>Step 3</b>
                                <p>I found a free open source template at <a href="https://html5up.net">HtmlUp</a> called <a href="https://html5up.net/stellar">Stellar</a>. I downloaded the template and saved it to a folder called "Alexander - Main" on my desktop. In this folder i will keep all my html files, images, pdf's and more data for my website. The file called "index.html" is the html file for the home page on the website. I opened the index file with Brackets.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/index.png" alt="" width="600" height="260"/></p>
                                
                                <b>Step 4</b>
                                <p>Finally I began to edit and write code in the Index file to display what I wanted on the home page until I was happy with the results. To make a new section or article dedicated to this project I made a new html file in my website folder called "making_a_website.html" and used the following code shown on the image bellow.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/making_a_website.png" alt="" width="600" height="260"/></p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/code_for_website.png" alt="" width="500" height="170"/></p>
                                <p>
                                In these lines of code i could add an small image for the article. This was the result:</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/portfolio.png" alt="" width="500" height="450"/></p>
                                
                                <p>
                                Once my homepage was ready I opened the making_a_webiste.html file in Bracket and started writing the code for the page you are reading now. I didnt really edit the original template much, just filled in the gaps and added images.</p>
                                
                                <b>Step 5</b>
                                <p>On the github website I created a new repository and uploaded all my files from my website folder. Heres how I did it. (Use this <a href="https://github.com/alexanderlvidal/Alexander">link</a> to see the repository.)
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/newrespo.png" alt="" width="275" height="315"/></p>
                                <p>Pro tip:</p>
                                <p>Make sure to check the box "Add a README file". By doing this you will not need gitbash to upload your files to github like the project description suggests. You simply press "Add file" -> "Upload Files" and drag the files from your website folder and press "Commit changes" and you are done.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/readme.png" alt="" width="990" height="440"/></p>
                                
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/upload.png" alt="" width="900" height="400"/></p>
                                
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/drag.png" alt="" width="900" height="400"/></p>
                        
                                <h3>Then my website was completed :)</h3>

                        <section id="content" class="main">
                            <h2>Resume</h2>
                            <p>Thankfully I already had a resume ready before this project so I only needed to find a way for the user to access it. I decided to add a button that can be pressed and the resume will be downloaded as a pdf file. I used the following code:</p>
                            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/kodi_cv.png" alt="" width="650" height="100"/></p>
                            <p>Then I uploaded the pdf to my respository</p>
                        </section>
                        
                        
                        
                         <section id="content" class="main">
                                <h2>Main challenges and how I dealt with them</h2>
                             <b>Number 1 - Images</b>
                                <p>At first I had problems sizing and centering my images. After few Google searches I found the following code:
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/image_upload.png" alt="" width="772" height="65"/></p>
                             <p>
                             With this code I can insert an image by searching the in the image folder. Here I can select where to position an image and select the size
                             </p>
                             <b>Number 2 - Adding a home button</b>
                             <p>I knew I needed to add a somekind of a button to take the user back to the homepage but I wasn't sure how I could do that. I wanted to have header on top of the page with a little home icon that stays in the same place as you scroll down. After I tried for 1,5 hours to make something work, googling and reading W3 school's webpage, I realized the template I'm using doesn't support that kind of a wrapper. In order to accomplish what I wanted, I needed to reprogram the main.css file and it's really involved to do. My best bet would be changing to a another template. I plan on doing that in the future but the good old back button have to do for now.</p>
